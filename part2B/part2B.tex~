\begin{enumerate}
\item A position vector is a vector pointing to a position in 3 dimensions. In relativity it could be useful to include the position in time and make a four dimensional position vector. Would such a vector obey the usual rules for vector aritmetics? (try to think about some simple examples, i.e. of adding position vectors)
\item We have seen that in the special theory of relativity, also the pace of time changes when you move. Could this be interpreted as you having a four-dimensional velocity including a time component of your velocity vector? How could you define such a 4 dimensional velocity?
\item The velocity of an object changes when you change your frame of reference. Does this mean that also momentum and energy are relative quantities? What happens in this case to the law of conservation of energy?

\section{Worldlines}
\label{sect:worldlines}

In the spacetime diagram  in figure \ref{fig:wl} we see the path of a particle (or any object) through spacetime. We see the different positions $(x,t)$ in space and time that the particle has passed through. Such a path showing the points in spacetime that an object passed is called a {\it worldline\label{pg:worldline}}. We will now study two events A and B (on the worldline of a particle) which are separated by a small spacetime interval $\Delta s$. These events could be the particle emitting two flashes of light or the particle passing through two specific points in space. The corresponding space and time intervals between these two events in the laboratory frame are called $\Delta t$ and $\Delta x$. From the figure you see that $\Delta t>\Delta x$. You can see that this also holds for every small spacetime interval along the path. This has to be this way: The speed of the particle at a given instant is $v=\Delta x/\Delta t$. If $\Delta x=\Delta t$ then $v=1$ and the particle travels at the speed of light. That $\Delta t>\Delta x$ simply means that the particle travels at a speed $v<c$ which it must. The worldline of a photon would thus be a line at $45^\circ$ with the coordinate axes. The worldline of any material particle will therefore always make less than $45^\circ$ with the time axis.

Events which are separated by spacetime distances such that $\Delta t>\Delta x$ are called {\it timelike events\label{pg:timelike}}. Timelike events may be causally connected since a particle with velocity $v<c$ would have the possibility to travel from one of the events to the other event. There is a possibility that the second event could have been caused by the first event since it is possible for a signal to travel between the events. Timelike events have positive line elements,
\[
\Delta s^2=\Delta t^2-\Delta x^2>0.
\]

\captionof{figure}{The worldline, the trajectory of a particle in a spacetime diagram. Two events A and B along the path of the particle have been marked.\label{fig:wl}}
%\end{center}
\end{Figure}


Events for which $\Delta t=\Delta x$ are called {\it lightlike events\label{pg:lightlike}}. Only a particle traveling at the speed of light ($v=\Delta x/\Delta t=1$) could travel from the first event to the second. Lightlike events have zero spacetime interval,
\[
\Delta s^2=\Delta t^2-\Delta x^2=0.
\]
Note one consequence of this: Remember that the proper time interval $\Delta \tau^2$ equals the spacetime interval $\Delta s^2$. Thus, photons always have $\Delta \tau=0$, the wristwatch attached to a photon would not change. Photons and other particles traveling at the speed of light do not feel the effect of time.

Events for which $\Delta x>\Delta t$ are called {\it spacelike events\label{pg:spacelike}}. For these events, the spatial component of the distance is larger than the time component. No worldline could ever connect two spacelike events as it would require a particle to travel faster than light. Thus, spacelike events are not causally connected. The first event could not have caused the second. The spacetime interval for spacelike events is negative,
\[
\Delta s^2=\Delta t^2-\Delta x^2<0.
\]

\captionof{figure}{Different worldlines connecting the two events A and B.\label{fig:ab}}
%\end{center}
\end{Figure}

In figure \ref{fig:ab} we see two events A and B and three different worldlines between these events. These events could be a car passing position $x_A$ and position $x_B$ in the laboratory frame. In the spacetime diagram we see three worldlines each corresponding to a car. The straight worldline must correspond to a car driving with constant speed $v=\Delta x/\Delta t=\mathrm{constant}$. The two other worldlines must correspond to cars accelerating (changing their speed and thereby changing the slope of the worldline) along the way from $x_A$ to $x_B$, but all cars reach point $x_B$ at the same time (event B). All cars also passed point $x_A$ at the same time (event A). Same time here means 'same time' for all frames of reference: all the cars meet at event A and B, so if they meet simultaneously in one frame of reference they must meet simultaneously in all other frames of reference (did you get this? If not, read the sentences again!). 

\pagebreak[2]

We will now ask a question which answer may seem obvious in this case, but which might not be so obvious in other situations. The question is: Given a particle (or a car) going from event A to event B. If this particle is in free float (in special relativity this means that no forces act on the particle), which worldline will the particle take between event A and event B? Looking back at figure \ref{fig:ab} we see three possible worldlines, but in fact there is an infinite number of possible worldlines connecting the two events. The obvious answer in this case is that it will follow a straight line in spacetime, i.e.\ the straight worldline corresponding to constant velocity. This is just a modern way of saying Newton's first law: A body which is not under the influence of external forces will continue moving with constant velocity. But is there a deeper principle behind? In the theory of relativity there is, and this principle is called the {\it principle of maximal aging\label{pg:maximalaging}}. This is a fundamental principle in the special as well as in the general theory of relativity.

The principle of maximal aging says that a particle in free float (no forces act on the particle) will follow the worldline which corresponds to the longest possible proper time interval between the two events. We remember that proper time is the wristwatch time\label{pg:wristwatchtime}, the time measured on the clock attached to the particle. So let different particles take different paths in spacetime between the two events. Attach a wristwatch to each of the particles. At event B, you look at the time interval between event A and B measured on the wristwatch of each of the particles. The particle which measures the longest proper time, i.e.\ the particle with the wristwatch which made most ticks during the trip from event A to event B, is the particle taking the path that a particle in free-float would take. 

How do we calculate the proper time interval that a given particle takes from event A to event B? The clue is to remember that the proper time interval $\Delta\tau$ between two events equals the spacetime interval, or the total length of the path in spacetime $\Delta s$ taken between the two events. For the worldline of a particle with constant velocity, we know that the distance in spacetime traveled from event A to event B is just $\Delta s=\sqrt{\Delta t^2-\Delta x^2}$ where $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$ are space and time intervals measured in an arbitrary frame of reference. To measure the total spacetime interval along the worldline of a particle which does not move with constant velocity, we need to break the path up into small path lengths $ds$. This path length is so small that we can assume the velocity to be constant during the time it takes to travel this interval in spacetime. We can thus write $ds=\sqrt{dt^2-dx^2}$ where $dx$ and $dt$ are the corresponding small space and time displacement measured in the arbitrary frame of reference. To obtain the total length of the path in spacetime traveled between two events A and B, we need to integrate all these tiny spacetime intervals $ds$ giving
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ds}
\Delta s=\int_A^B\sqrt{dt^2-dx^2}.
\end{equation}
This equals measuring the length $s$ of a curved path between two points A and B in the x-y plane:
\[
\Delta s=\int_A^B\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2}.
\]
Note again a huge difference here: The minus sign in the spacetime interval. We know from Euclidean geometry that the shortest path $s$ between two points A and B in the plane, is the straight line. The minus sign in the line element for Lorentz geometry gives rise to the opposite result (which we will not derive here): The \emph{longest} path $s$ between two events A and B in spacetime is the straight worldline. Therefore, if we measure the length of the spacetime path for all the three worldlines in figure \ref{fig:ab} using the integral in (\ref{eq:ds}), we find that the longest path in spacetime is the straight worldline, i.e.\ the worldline of the car driving with constant velocity. Remember again that the length of the spacetime interval $\Delta s$ equals the total proper time $\Delta\tau$ measured on the wristwatch of the particle. So the longest proper time interval between two events is measured on the particle taking the straight line in spacetime, i.e.\ the particle which has constant velocity. We have just deduced Newton's first law from the principle of maximal aging. When we come to the general theory of relativity, we will see that the spacetime geometry and hence the form of the line elements $\Delta s$ is different in a gravitational field. We will need the principle of maximal aging to tell us how a free float particle is moving in this case.

An example of a light cone, the three-dimensional surface of all possible light rays arriving at and departing from a point in spacetime. Here it is depicted with one spatial dimension suppressed. In general, there are three types of curves in spacetime: 1) Time-like curves, with a speed less than the speed of light. These curves must fall within a cone defined by light-like curves. 2) Light-like curves, having at each point the speed of light. They form a cone in spacetime, dividing it into two parts. 3) Space-like curves, falling outside the light cone. (Figure: Wikipedia)

\section{Four-vectors}
\label{sect:fourvectors}

We are used to vectors in three-dimensional space giving the position of a point in space,
\[
\vec{x}=(x_1,x_2,x_3),
\]
where $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ are used instead of $(x,y,z)$ for the components in the three spatial dimensions. A 4-vector is similarly defined to give the position of an \emph{event} in four dimensional spacetime,
\[
x=(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3),
\]
or if you wish $(t,x,y,z)$. For components of a normal three dimensional vector, we use Latin letters, typically $i$ and $j$,  for the indices: The components of $\vec{x}$ are $x_i$ where $i$ goes from 1 to 3. For the components of a 4-vector, we use Greek indices, typically $\mu$ and $\nu$. The components of a four-vector $x$ are $x_\mu$ where $\mu$ run from 0 to 3, 0 being the time component. If we wish to separate the time and space part of a four-vector we might also write it as $x=(t,x_i)$ where $x_i$ refers to all three spatial components.

The four-vector $x_\mu$ points to an event in spacetime for a given frame of reference. We have already learned that in order to transform spacetime coordinates from one frame of reference to another, we need the Lorentz transformations. Thus, we may write the transformation of a four-vector $x_\mu$ in one frame of reference to $x_\mu'$ in another frame of reference by a matrix multiplication,
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
t' \\
x' \\
y' \\
z'  
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma&-v\gamma&0&0\\
-v\gamma&\gamma&0&0\\
0&0&1&0\\
0&0&0&1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
t \\
x \\
y \\
z \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]


Compare with the expression for the Lorentz transformation in the previous lecture notes. Check that the matrix multiplication gives you the correct equations. (Compare this equation with matrices which are used to rotate between coordinate systems in two spatial dimensions, do you see a similarity? Remember the analogy used in the previous lecture notes between a coordinate change in the $(x,y)$ plane and the $(x,t)$ diagram). 

We can write this matrix equation as
\[
x_\mu'=\sum_{\nu=0}^3c_{\mu\nu}x_\nu,
\]
where $c_{\mu\nu}$ is the matrix above. This is the equation which transforms any four-vector from one frame of reference to another. We will now write this equation using the so-called Einstein conventions. This is just a rule which will save you from a lot of writing. Instead of writing the sum symbol, we simply say that when two factors in a term contain the same index, there is an implicit sum over this index. If the index is Latin, then there is a sum over the three spatial dimensions, if the index is Greek, there is a sum over the three spatial dimensions plus time. Using this convention we can write the previous equation simply as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lorentz}
x_\mu'=c_{\mu\nu}x_\nu
\end{equation}


It can be shown that four-vectors follow the normal rules for summations and subtractions (see exercises). We will now look at the scalar product. For three dimensional vectors, the usual scalar product can be written as,
\[
\vec{x}\cdot\vec{y}=\sum_{i=1}^3x_iy_i=x_iy_i,
\]
where the Einstein convention was used in the last expression. We can also define a scalar product for four-vectors. Instead of writing a dot between the vectors, one usually writes the scalar product with one upper index and one lower index,
\[
x^\mu y_\mu=x_0y_0-x_iy_i.
\]
One index $\mu$ is written high and the other low to show that this is the scalar product and \emph{not} a normal sum. Note that the scalar product is defined with a minus sign in front of the spatial part. If we had written both indices low, this would mean,
\[
x_\mu y_\mu=x_0y_0+x_iy_i,
\]
using the Einstein summation convention. This is different from the scalar product. It should be clear where the minus sign comes from, consider a spacetime interval $\Delta x_\mu$ (a spacetime interval is an interval between two points $x_\mu^1$ and $x_\mu^2$ in time and space such that $\Delta x_\mu=x_\mu^1-x_\mu^2=(\Delta t,\Delta x,\Delta y,\Delta z)$). The scalar product of a spacetime interval with itself gives,
\[
\Delta x^\mu\Delta x_\mu=\Delta t^2-\Delta x^2=\Delta s^2
\]
(assuming $\Delta y=\Delta z=0$). The result is the {\it scalar\label{pg:scalar}} $\Delta s^2$. A scalar is a quantity which is invariant, which has the same value in all frames of reference. We already knew that the spacetime interval $\Delta s^2$ is a scalar (where did we learn this?). For infinitesimal distances between events, we may write this as,
\[
ds^2=dx^\mu dx_\mu.
\]

We learned above that a four vector\label{pg:fourvector} is a vector which transforms according to the Lorentz transformation (equation \ref{eq:lorentz}) when changing from one frame of reference to another frame of reference having velocity $v$ with respect to the first. This has an important consequence: You cannot choose 4 numbers on random, put them together and call it a 4-vector! The numbers entering in a four-vector need to be physical quantities which are such that the 4-vector transforms accoring to equation \ref{eq:lorentz}. We thus need to take care when performing mathematical operations with 4-vectors: The result may not necessarily be a 4-vector.

As an example we will now investigate what happens with a 4-vector when multiplying it with some number. Say that you for some reason need to multiply a spacetime distance $\Delta x_\mu=(\Delta t,\Delta x,\Delta y,\Delta z)$ with the corresponding time interval $\Delta t$ forming 
\[
\Delta y_\mu=\Delta t\Delta x_\mu.
\]
Is $\Delta y_\mu$ a 4-vector? We can easily check this by checking whether it transforms according to equation \ref{eq:lorentz} when changing frame of reference. We therefore need to find $\Delta y_\mu'$ as
\[
\Delta y_\mu'=\Delta t'\Delta x_\mu'
\]
and test if equation \ref{eq:lorentz} is satisfied.

We know that $\Delta x_\mu$ follows this transformation. We also now that $\Delta t'=(1/\gamma)\Delta t$ when changing frame of reference. We thus have for $\Delta y_\mu'$ in a new frame of reference
\[
\Delta y_\mu'=\Delta t'\Delta x_\mu'=(1/\gamma)\Delta tc_{\mu\nu}\Delta x_\nu=(1/\gamma) c_{\mu\nu}\Delta y_\nu.
\]
Because of the factor $1/\gamma$ we see that $\Delta y_\mu$ does not transform according to equation \ref{eq:lorentz} and $\Delta y_\mu$ is therefore NOT a 4-vector. We thus cannot multiply a 4-vector with a time interval and obtain a 4-vector.

A four-vector which is multiplied by a scalar however, is itself a four-vector. If instead of multiplying $\Delta x_\mu$ with $\Delta t$, we multiply it with the corresponding spacetime interval $\Delta s$ we get
\[
\Delta y_\mu=\Delta s\Delta x_\mu.
\]
Transforming to a different frame of reference we have again $\Delta x_\mu'=c_{\mu\nu}\Delta x_\nu$ since $\Delta x_\mu$ is a four-vector and $\Delta s'=\Delta s$ since $\Delta s$ is a scalar. We thus have
\[
\Delta y_\mu'=\Delta s'\Delta x_\mu'=\Delta sc_{\mu\nu}\Delta x_\nu=c_{\mu\nu}\Delta y_\nu
\]
which does follow equation \ref{eq:lorentz}. In this case $\Delta y_\mu$ is a four-vector. We thus have generally that when $A_\mu$ is a four vector and $f$ is a scalar, the product
\[
B_\mu=fA_\mu,
\]
is a 4-vector. In the exercises you will show that the results of summing or subtracting 4-vectors are 4-vectors.


\section{Four-velocity}
\label{sect:fourvel}

Can we define a four dimensional velocity $V_\mu$, that is, a four dimensional vector showing the direction of motion in spacetime of a particle with coordinates $x_\mu$? By analogy to normal three dimensional velocity, the four-velocity $V_\mu$ should be the the rate of change of the position vector $x_\mu$. A natural choice would be $dx_\mu/dt$, but this is not a four-vector: As we discussed above, $\Delta t$ or $dt$ is not a scalar, it has different values in different frames of reference. Thus $dx_\mu/dt$ does not transform as a 4-vector, i.e.\ you cannot use the Lorentz transformation to transform it from one frame of reference to another. But in order to have velocity, we need the rate of change with respect to some time interval $\Delta t$. Which measure of time can we use?

Remember that proper time $\tau$ is a scalar, it is defined as the time observed on the wristwatch of an observer. All observers will measure the same time interval $\Delta\tau$ between two events (how do they measure $\Delta\tau$?). Consider the example with the train and observer P who is jumping up and down. Measured on the wrist watch of observer P, one jump takes one second, thus one second of proper time for the frame of reference of the train. According to observer O's wristwatch, the jump takes 1.7 seconds, but this is not the proper time for the train (remember the definition of proper time!). But observer O can take his binoculars and read of the time between each jump on observer P's wristwatch. He will then find, in agreement with observer P, that in proper time units for the train, each jump takes one second. 

Note that proper time needs to be defined with respect to some frame of reference (in this case the train), but once this is defined, everybody agrees on the proper time interval between two events taking place at the same spot in that frame. In the case of four-velocity, there is no doubt about which proper time we are speaking about: Four-velocity is the velocity of a particle or an object (for instance a train) and the proper time $\Delta\tau$ which we use to define four velocity is the time measured in the rest frame of this object. So four-velocity\label{pg:fourvelocity} can be defined as
\[
V_\mu=\frac{dx_\mu}{d\tau}.
\]
Let us find the length (absolute value) of the four-velocity (the square root of the scalar product of the vector with itself). The square of the length is (as for normal vectors) given by
\[
V_\mu V^\mu=\frac{dx_\mu}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau}=\frac{dx_\mu dx^\mu}{d\tau^2}=\frac{ds^2}{d\tau^2}=\frac{d\tau^2}{d\tau^2}=1.
\]
(did you understand every step here?)
Taking the square root of this we still get 1. The length of the four-velocity is thus always one. Remember that a velocity of one means the velocity of light. All particles move with the velocity of light in spacetime! For each proper time interval $\Delta\tau$ a particle moves an equal interval $\Delta s$ in spacetime.

\captionof{figure}{The observer on the ground measuring a velocity $v_x$ for the airplane, wondering which velocity $v_x'$ the driver of the car measures for the same airplane.\label{fig:vx}}
%\end{center}
\end{Figure}

We can write the four-velocity in terms of normal 3-velocity as
\begin{formbox}
\begin{align*}
&V_\mu=(\frac{dt}{d\tau},\frac{dx_i}{d\tau})\\
&=(\frac{dt}{d\tau},\frac{dt}{d\tau}\frac{dx_i}{dt})=\frac{dt}{d\tau}(1,\vec{v})=\gamma(1,\vec{v})
\end{align*}
\end{formbox}
where we have used that $\Delta t/\Delta\tau=dt/d\tau=\gamma$ from the previous lecture notes (go back and check how you derived this, it is important!). Now we are ready to answer a question that has bothered us all the time since we learned about the Lorentz transformations: We know how to transform between coordinates $(x,t)$  and $(x',t')$ in two different frames of reference. But how do you transform a velocity $v_x$ from one frame to the other? Say that you stand on the ground and look at a passing airplane. You measure the velocity of the airplane along the x-axis to be $v_x$. A car is passing you on the street with velocity $v_\mathrm{rel}$ along the same x-axis and you note that the driver is also watching the airplane. You start to wonder which velocity $v_x'$ that the driver is measuring for the airplane. The situation is depicted in figure \ref{fig:vx}. In normal non-relativistic physics you know that the answer should read $v_x'=v_x-v_\mathrm{rel}$, but we have learned that this does not work for velocities close to the velocities of light (for instance, look back at the Michelson-Morley experiment). Assuming that there are no motions in the $y$ and $z$ direction, we can now write the four velocity of the airplane from our laboratory frame as $V_\mu=\gamma(1,v_x)$ and from the car as $V_\mu'=\gamma'(1,v_x')$ where $\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-v_x^2}$ and $\gamma'=1/\sqrt{1-(v_x')^2}$. We know that four-velocity is a four-vector and that four-vectors by definition transform from one frame of reference to the other under the Lorentz transformation,
\begin{formbox}
\[
V_\mu'=c_{\mu\nu}V_\nu,
\]
\end{formbox}
or written in terms of matrices as
\begin{formbox}
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma'\\
\gamma'v_x'\\
\gamma'v_y'\\
\gamma'v_z'
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_\mathrm{rel}&-v_\mathrm{rel}\gamma_\mathrm{rel}&0&0\\
-v_\mathrm{rel}\gamma_\mathrm{rel}&\gamma_\mathrm{rel}&0&0\\
0&0&1&0\\
0&0&0&1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma\\
\gamma v_x\\
\gamma v_y\\
\gamma v_z
\end{pmatrix}
\]
where $\gamma_\mathrm{rel}=1/\sqrt{1-v_\mathrm{rel}^2}$.
\end{formbox}
From this matrix equation, we obtain two equations for the velocity $v_x$ and $v_x'$,
\begin{align*}
\gamma'&=(\gamma_\mathrm{rel}-v_\mathrm{rel}\gamma_\mathrm{rel}v_x)\gamma\\
\gamma'v_x'&=(-v_\mathrm{rel}\gamma_\mathrm{rel}+\gamma_\mathrm{rel}v_x)\gamma.
\end{align*}
Dividing the second equation by the first, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vel}
v_x'=\frac{v_x-v_\mathrm{rel}}{1-v_\mathrm{rel}v_x},
\end{equation}
which is the Lorentz transformation for velocities. Note that when the speed of the airplane approaches the speed of light, $v_x\rightarrow1$ then $v_x'\rightarrow1$ showing that the laboratory observer and the observer in the car will both measure the speed of light for the airplane. This solves the weird result obtained by Michelson and Moreley: The speed of light is the same from all frames of reference.

\section{Relativistic momentum and energy}
\label{sect:energy}

What about momentum and energy? We have learned that the velocity $v$ of an object as measured from two different frames of reference transform according to the Lorentz transformation (equation \ref{eq:vel}). This must necessarily have consequences for how we measure momentum $p=mv$ and energy $E=1/2mv^2$ from two different frames of reference. There must be some corresponding Lorentz transformations for momentum and energy. We have learned a simple and easy recipe for finding the transformation equations between different frames: Construct a four-vector and use the transformation properties for four-vectors. This worked for velocity so let's try with momentum and energy.

We start with momentum. In order to construct a four-vector $P_\mu$ for momentum, let's try a form which is as similar as possible to the Newtonian form $\vec{p}=m\vec{v}$. Rest mass (the mass measured in the rest frame of the object) is a scalar quantity, so
\[
P_\mu=mV_\mu
\]
is a four-vector. Using that $V_\mu=\gamma(1,\vec{v})$, we can write momentum as
\begin{formbox}
\[
P_\mu=m\gamma(1,\vec{v})=\gamma(m,\vec{p}),
\]
\end{formbox}
where $\vec{p}$ is the Newtonian momentum. Taking the spatial part of this equation we see that relativistic momentum can be written in three dimensions simply as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p}
\vec{p}_\mathrm{relativistic}=\gamma m \vec{v},
\end{equation}
where $\vec{v}$ is the normal 3-velocity of an object. What is the meaning of the time component $P_0=\gamma m$ of the momentum 4-vector? In order to investigate this let us write it in the Newtonian limit. For $v<<1$ (velocity much lower than the velocity of light) we can make a Taylor expansion in $v$,
\[
P_0(v)=P_0(v=0)+\frac{dP_0}{dv}(v=0)v+\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2P_0}{dv^2}(v=0)v^2,
\]
where the derivatives taken at $v=0$ are (check it!) $P_0(v=0)=m$, $dP_0/dv(v=0)=0$ and $d^2P_0/dv^2(v=0)=m$. We get
\[
P_0=m+\frac{1}{2}mv^2.
\]
The last term is just the expression for Newtonian kinetic energy. The first term is the {\it rest energy} of a particle, converted to normal units it can be written as the more well known  $E=mc^2$. The rest energy is the energy of a particle at rest, it is the energy in the mass of the particle. Thus, the time component of the momentum four-vector is relativistic energy,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:E}
E_\mathrm{relativistic}=m\gamma,
\end{equation}
which in the Newtonian limit reduces to the Newtonian kinetic energy plus an energy term which did not exist in Newtonian physics, the energy of the mass of the particle. So the 4-vector $P_\mu$ is not just a momentum 4-vector, it is {\it the momentum-energy 4-vector} which time component is energy and space component is momentum. It means that energy and momentum are related in the same way as space and time are. In the same manner as we talk about spacetime, indicating that space and time are basically two aspects of the same thing, we can call energy and momentum collectively as {\it momenergy\label{pg:momenergy}}. The four-vector $P_\mu$ is simply the {\it momenergy four-vector}.

What is the length of the momenergy four-vector? Using that $P_\mu=mV_\mu$ we have for the square of the length
\[
P_\mu P^\mu=m^2V_\mu V^\mu=m^2.
\]
The length is the square root of $m^2$ which is $m$. The length of the momenergy four-vector is an invariant and it is thus simply the mass. We have seen that we can write $P_\mu=\gamma(m,\vec{p})$ giving (using equations \ref{eq:p} and \ref{eq:E})
\[
P_\mu=(E_\mathrm{relativistic},\vec{p}_\mathrm{relativistic}).
\]
From now on we will drop the subscript 'relativistic' and always refer to the relativistic energy and relativistic momentum using $E$ and $p$. But how can we be so sure? How can we know that this is the correct expression for energy and momentum? What is the criterion for a quantity to be energy or momentum? We know that energy and momentum are conserved quantities. The total energy and momentum of particles after a collision should always be the same as the total energy and momentum before the collision. So this is easy to check: Measure the total energy and momentum of particles before and after a collision, if they are the same we have found the correct expressions for momenergy. This has been tested thousands of times in particle accelerators with particles moving close to the speed of light. It turns out that the Newtonian energy and momentum are \emph{not} conserved in these collisions. The relativistic energy and momentum defined as we have done above however, \emph{are} conserved.

By now we have got used to measure time and space in the same units and therefore we have also got used to add these quantities $\Delta x+\Delta t$ without hesitating. We see that the result of measuring time and space in the same units is that momentum and energy are also measured in the same units, the units of mass. We remember that since space and time are measured in the same units, the speed $v$ is a dimensionless number. The factor $\gamma$ is clearly also dimensionless, so the momentum $p=m\gamma v$ can be measured in the units of mass (kg). The same goes for energy $E=m\gamma$, which also has dimension mass. So both energy and momentum are measured in kg and these quantities can therefore be added, just as we can add intervals in time and distances in space. The momenergy four-vector is $P_\mu=(E,\vec{p})$, taking the scalar product we have (remembering the result above that the length of $P_\mu$ is just $m$),
\[
P_\mu P^\mu=E^2-p^2=m^2,
\]
we can thus write energy in terms of momentum as
\[
E=\sqrt{m^2+p^2}.
\]
A photon is massless, so for photons this relation is just
\[
E=p,
\]
or by using normal units $E=pc$ which is a more known form of this expression.

We return to the above example with the airplane and the passing car. You measure the relativistic energy and momentum of the airplane from the laboratory frame (the ground) and you wonder what energy and momentum the driver of the car measures for the same airplane. The momenergy four-vector is a four-vector which means that it can be transformed from one frame of reference to the other by the Lorentz transformation,
\begin{formbox}
\[
P_\mu'=c_{\mu\nu}P_\nu,
\]
\end{formbox}
or in matrix form (remember that there were no movements in the $y$ and $z$ direction)
\begin{formbox}
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
E'\\
p_x'\\
p_y'\\
p_z'
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_\mathrm{rel}&-v_\mathrm{rel}\gamma_\mathrm{rel}&0&0\\
-v_\mathrm{rel}\gamma_\mathrm{rel}&\gamma_\mathrm{rel}&0&0\\
0&0&1&0\\
0&0&0&1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
E\\
p_x\\
p_y\\
p_z
\end{pmatrix}
\]
\end{formbox}

Giving the following transformation equations for momentum and energy
\begin{align*}
E'&=\gamma_\mathrm{rel}E-v_\mathrm{rel}\gamma_\mathrm{rel}p_x\\
p_x'&=\gamma_\mathrm{rel}p_x-v_\mathrm{rel}\gamma_\mathrm{rel}E
\end{align*}
where $v_\mathrm{rel}$ is the relative velocity between the two frames of reference, the observer on the ground and the car (see figure \ref{fig:px}). 

\begin{Figure}%[tbp]

\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig_9-4.pdf}
\captionof{figure}{The observer on the ground measuring a velocity $v_x$ for the airplane, wondering which velocity $v_x'$ the driver of the car measures for the same airplane.\label{fig:px}}
%\end{center}
\end{Figure}



We will now use these equations to answer the following question: What energy and momentum $(E',p_x'$) does a person passing you in his car with a velocity $v$ (relative to you) measure that you have? From your frame of reference in which you are at rest, your momentum is by definition zero $p=0$ and you energy equals your mass $E=m$. We will now transform these quantities to the driver of the car measuring your energy and momentum to be $E'$ and $p'$. The relative velocity of the car with respect to you is simply $v_\mathrm{rel}=v$. Then the energy and momentum that the driver in the car measures that you have is simply (using the equations above, check that you get the same result),
\[
E'=\gamma E\ \ \ \ p_x'=-v\gamma E
\]
Note that $\gamma>1$ so the driver in the car measures, not only a larger absolute momentum, but also larger energy. 

From the point of view of Newtonian mechanics this was to be expected: with respect to the driver you have a non-zero velocity and kinetic energy, thus both your momentum  and energy are clearly larger with respect to him than with respect to your rest frame. But from the point of view of geometry it might seem strange: In your rest frame the four-vector $P_\mu$ only has a time component and no space component. In the frame of the driver, both the time and space component of the vector are larger than in your frame. But the length of the momenergy vector $P_\mu$ is always the same, equal to $m$. Going back to normal 3D geometry this would not be possible. Imagine a vector $\vec{a}=(f,g,0)$ and another vector $\vec{b}=(2f,h,0)$. If the length of these vectors are the same, then we have that $h<g$. We see that from normal geometry you would expect that if the length of a vector is constant, then if you increase one component of the vector the other should decrease. The reason for this discrepancy with normal geometry is that spacetime has Lorentz geometry whereas 3D space has Euclidean geometry. Lorentz geometry has a minus sign in the definition of the scalar product (which also defines the length of the vector) making such an effect possible.

Now you know the basics of the special theory of relativity and you have got the necessary preparations to start studying the general theory of relativity. In the general theory of relativity we will study how masses curve spacetime, making the expression for the line element $\Delta s$ different close to a large mass. This change in the line element changes the dynamics and gives rise to what we in Newtonian terms call the force of gravity.

\newcommand{\newproblem}[1]{\refstepcounter{problem}\label{#1}{\bf Exercise \refproblem{#1}}}

\newproblem{prob:xtdiagram}

You need to read section \ref{sect:worldlines} before embarking on this exercise.  Go to MCAst and load the xml corresponding to this exercise. There are three frames and one xml for each frame. You should be three students on this exercise, you should agree who does which frame.

In the video you can see the planet as well as 4 space ships travelling at different speeds along the x-axis. One frame is the planet frame, the other frames are the frames of space ship 1 and 2. Space ship 3 is accelerating, all other objects move with constant speed. We are not interested in exact numbers in this exercise, only roughly correct relative distances and slopes on the worldlines showing that you have understood the basic principles.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a spacetime diagram in the your frame showing the worldlines of the planets and all space ships (including yourself)
\item Make a spacetime diagram in the reference frames of ship 1 and 2.
\item Make a spacetime diagram in the reference frame of ship 3.
\item Now all three of you should meet up and compare videos as space-time diagrams. Are the movements in the other frame as you expected?
\item Return to the spacetime diagram for the planet frame, we will only work with this diagram in the rest of this exercise. We now define event 1 as the event when all space ships are in the same position at $x=0$ and $t=0$. Event 2 is defined as the event when space ship 3 just arrives at the position and velocity of space ship 2. Measured on the clock in the planet frame it takes 10 milliseconds between the two events, on the clock in the frame of ship 2, it takes 8 milliseconds. Assume that the clocks make a tick every millisecond. The first tick happens at event 1 and the last tick happens at event 2. Draw dots on the worldline of ship 2 at roughly the positions of each of the ticks. The important point here is to have correct relative spacings between each tick.
\item Space ship 3 has an identical clock which ticks with exactly the same frequency in the rest frame of the clock. Use the principle of maximal aging to judge whether an astronaut in ship 3 will experience more or less ticks on the clock from event 1 to event 2 (compared to the astronaut in ship 2)..
\item Again, draw dots on the worldline of ship 3 at the positions where the clock ticks. Again, the exact position is not important, but the relative distances between the dots should be correct. {\bf Hint:} For each dot you draw, look at the slope of the worldline.
\end{enumerate}

\newproblem{prob:deffourvec}

You should read section \ref{sect:fourvectors} before doing this exercise. A four vector is defined to be a vector in spacetime which transforms from one frame of reference to another (from $x_\mu$ to $x_\mu'$) using the Lorentz transformation
\[
x_\mu'=c_{\mu\nu}x_\nu.
\]
To check if a four dimensional vector is a four-vector, you need to check whether this relation is true or not. We will now test if four-vectors follow the normal rules of addition, that the sum of two four-vectors is really a four-vector. Assume you have two four-vectors $A_\mu$ and $B_\mu$. You sum the two to make a vector $D_\mu$,
\[
D_\mu=A_\mu+B_\mu.
\]
You now need to show that the result, $D_\mu$, is also a 4-vector. Use the transformation properties of $A_\mu$ and $B_\mu$ to obtain these vectors in a different frame $A_\mu'$ and $B_\mu'$. Find an expression for the sum of the two vectors, $D_\mu'$, in the other frame expressed by $D_\mu$ in the laboratory frame and show that $D_\mu$ is indeed a four vector.

\newproblem{prob:laserbeam}

You need to read sections \ref{sect:worldlines} - \ref{sect:fourvel} before embarking on this exercise.  Go to MCAst and load the xml corresponding to this exercise, you and your partner should agree on who does which frame. 

A spaceship is moving with a speed close to the speed of light and emitting two laser beams. This is seen from the frame of reference of the planet and the spaceship.

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf In the planet frame:} use the clock and ruler to find the velocity of the space ship and the light beam. Check that the beam has indeed the speed of light. What speed would you have expected the light beam to have if you rely on classical physics? {\bf In the space ship frame:} use the time and ruler to find the velocity of the light beams. Check that the beam has indeed the speed of light. Your velocity with respect to the ground is given in the upper left corner.
\item Make a space-time diagram of the space ship and the two laser beams in your frame of reference as well as in the other frame of reference.
\item Can you imagine how the scene looks like in the other frame? Focus in particular on the relative velocity and distances between beams and space ship. What will be the main differences in the movements between your frame and the other frame? You do not need to do any calculations here, only describe (maybe draw) qualitatively how the scene will look different. {\bf For the space ship frame:} what velocity would you expect the light beam to have in the planet frame, if you rely on classical physics?
\item Use the formula for transformation of velocities, to calculate the velocity of the laser beam in the other frame. Is the result as expected?
\item Now you should meet and compare videos. Does the other video look as expected? Why? Why not?
\item Now both of you should use the ruler to measure the distance between the two beams in your frame. Imagine a stick which has its start and end point at the position of these two beams. Find the ratio of the distances (of the stick lengths) between the two frames.
\item Compare this ratio, to what you expect from the formula for length contraction ($L=L_0/\gamma$). Does the formula for length contraction apply in this case? Why not?
\end{enumerate}

\newproblem{prob:conservation}

It is necessary to read all of the main text of this part to be able to do this exercise. Go to MCAst and load the xml corresponding to this exercise, you and your partner should agree on who does which frame. 

A small space ship is bringing passengers from the planet to the big space ship hotel. The passenger ship is travelling with velocity $v_A$, the hotel ship is travelling with velocity $v_B$ and the hotel ship combined with the passenger ship is (after landing on the hotel ship) travelling with a velcity $v_C$, all velocities with respect to the ground. Frame 1 is the planet frame, frame 2 is the frame of the combined ship (note for frame 2: the video is always in the frame of the combined ship, even before they combine).

Mass of the ships $m_A$, $m_B$ as well as the combined ship $m_C$ is given in the upper left corner. Note that masses are not additive in special relativity, you will discover this towards the end of the exercise, but for now remember that you must use the given actual mass of the combined ship instead of the sum of the individual ships.

The main goal of this exercise is to use the mass of the space ships as well as the total velocity after combination to find the velocity of each space ship in the planet frame. You will see how transforming 4-vectors from one frame to the other can reduce the number of calculations considerably: In the frame of the combined ship these calculations are much easier since the combined ship has a very simple energy-momentum 4-vector in this frame. In the planet frame, the calculations would have been a lot more work since all ships have non-zero velocities. But don't worry: no matter which frame you use, you will do the calculations in the frame of the combined ship.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Look at the size and speeds of the space ships: Does the appaerent velocities before and after combination make sense thinking of momentum and energy conservation? (no calculations here, only reasoning)
\item Without looking, try to imagine how the scene looks in the other frame: What are the relative speeds and in which directions are the ships moving? (no calculations here, only reasoning)
\item {\bf For the planet frame:} use the ruler and the clock to find the velocity of the combined ship (only the combined ship, not the individual ships). {\bf For the combined ship frame:} in the upper left corner, the velocity of the ground with respect to your frame is given.
\item Write an expression for the momenergy four-vector $P_\mu'(A)$ of the small space ship in the combined ship frame expressed in terms of $m_A$ and the unknown velocity $v_A'$.
\item Write an expression for the momenergy four-vector $P_\mu'(B)$ of the hotel ship (before combining) in the combined ship frame expressed in terms of $m_B$ and the unknown velocity $v_B'$.
\item Write an expression for the momenergy four-vector $P_\mu'(C)$ of the combined ship in the combined ship frame expressed in terms of $m_C$.
\item Use conservation of momenergy
\[
P_\mu'(C)=P_\mu'(A)+P_\mu'(B),
\]
to find the velocities $v_A'$ and $v_B'$ of the small ship and the hotel ship before combination in the frame of the combined ship. (insert numbers). {\bf Hint:} This can be ugly if you don't do it right: Write the momentum part of the equation in terms of $\gamma$-factors only (eliminate velocities), then substitute for one of the $\gamma$ from the energy part of the eqaution. Then you will avoid second order equations and obtain a simple first order equation for $\gamma'$. You will save a lot of work if you insert numbers as soon as you arrive at an expression for $\gamma'$. Using numbers, it is now easy to obtain velocities. Note that there are two possible solutions here: see if you understand why. Choose one of the solutions and continue with that in the rest of this exercise.
\item {\bf Only for the combined frame:} use the ruler and clock to measure the ship velocities and compare with the numbers you calculated.{\bf Only for the planet frame:} did the velocities (and in particular the directions) agree with what you imagined using only reasoning above?
\item Use the transformation properties for four-vectors
\[
P_\mu'=c_{\mu\nu}P_\nu
\]
to find the energy and momentum of the small ship and the hotel ship in the planet frame. (insert numbers:what units do your results have if you keep $c=1$).
\item Use the numbers you have obtained for energy or momentum to obtain the speed of the two ships in the planet frame.
\item Repeat the previous exercise using $m_C = m_A + m_B$. Can the total mass actually equal the sum of the masses? This result will be very important when we will discuss nuclear reactions.
\item Now meet with the other student and use the video in the planet frame: use the ruler and clock to check your result for the speed of the ships in the planet frame. Did the other scene look like you imagined in the question above? If not, where was your reasoning incorrect?
\item As an independent check (and to see an alternative way of doing it), use the relativistic formula for addition of velocities to obtain the speed of the two ships in the planet frame, using only the speed you have obtained for the hotel ship in the combined frame as well as the speed of the combined ship in the planet frame.
\item For those who like long and ugly calculations only: Do everything from the beginning, but use only the planet frame to obtain the same results. Do you see the advantage of using 4-vectors and change of frames?
\item This exercise was inspired by a process which happens in nature (albeit with the sequence of events reversed): A free neutron has a mean life time of about 12 minutes after which it disintegrates into a proton, an electron and a neutrino. If we ignore the neutrino which has very small mass and energy, the neutrino corresponds to the combined ship, the electron and proton to the small ship and hotel ship. Compare the neutron mass to the sum of the electron and proton mass (the neutrino mass is too small to explain this discrepancy): clearly mass is not conserved. Now play the MCast videos in reverse (use the speed slider to make it reverse) and imagine the ships being elementary particles.
\end{enumerate}

\newproblem{prob:conservation2}
 
It is necessary to read all of the main text of this part to be able to do this exercise. Go to MCAst and load the xml corresponding to this exercise, you and your partner should agree on who does which frame. 

Some crazy researchers have decided to test special relativity. They prepare two identical space ships and travel towards each other with a velocity close to the speed of light until they collide. The mass $m$ of the space ship is shown in the upper left corner. Two observers (you) will measure the photons from the explosion, one observer on the ground (frame 1) and the other observer in a small spaceship following just behind one of the colliding space ships (frame 2).

One of the space ships is made solely from anti-matter (and the researcher driving the space ship has also converted all the atoms in her body to anti-atoms). Therefore, in the collision, all the matter is annhilated and converted to photons. No matter is left. We also assume that all photons will have exactly the same wavelength. The photon detectors on the ground will tell you (in the upper left corner) how many photons were produced in the explosion.

The main goal of this exercise is to use the transformation of momenergy 4-vectors to deduce a relativistic formula for Doppler shift.

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf For the planet observer:} Use the clock and the ruler to find the velocity of the space ships in your frame. Then use this velocity to find the velocity of space ship B (the right space ship) in the reference frame of the left space ship A (transform the velocity with your preferred method). Note that you can see your fellow student following space ship A in a small red space ship. {\bf For the observer following space ship A in the same frame of reference as space ship A:} Your velocity with respect to the ground is given in the upper left corner. Use this to find the velocity of the colliding space ship in your frame (transform the velocity with your preferred method).
\item Write down the momenergy four-vectors $P_\mu(A)$ and $P_\mu(B)$ of the two space ships in your frame of reference.
\item Use the transformation properties of four-vectors to transform momenergy four-vectors from your frame of reference to the other frame. (again insert numbers). You should now have $P_\mu(A)$ and $P_\mu(B)$ in the planet frame as well as $P'_\mu(A)$ and $P'_\mu(B)$ in the space ship frame.
\item Show that the momenergy four-vector of a photon traveling in the positive x-direction can be written
\[
P_\mu^\gamma=(E,E,0,0),
\]
where $E$ is the energy of the photon.
\item Assume for the moment that all the energy in the explosion is emitted in only two photons, one emitted along the positive x-axis (same direction as the space ship) and the other in the opposite directions (negative x-direction). Use conservation of momenergy in the planet frame to argue that the two photons must have the same energy seen from the planet frame.
\item Now assume that these two photons are emitted with an angle $\theta$ off the x-axis. Write the momenery 4-vector for this photon and use again conservation of momenergy in the planet frame to argue that the two photons must have the same energy but opposite directions seen from the planet frame.
\item Use your previous results to argue that if there are photons emitted in all possible directions, there is, for all photons emitted always another photon emitted in the opposite direction with the same energy.(remember that we assume that all photons produced in this explosion has the same energy)
\item Using the assumption that all photons are emitted with the same wavelenght, and using also the number of photons measured, what is the energy of the photons and thereby the wavelength in the planet frame?
\item Use the wavelength to find the color of the explosion seen in the planet frame (use the table in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum}{this Wikipedia article.}){\bf For the observer in the planet frame:} does it correspond to the colour you observe?
\item We will now study only the photons which move along the x-axis. Use transformation properties for four-vectors to show that the energy $E'$ of a photon in a frame moving with velocity $v$ with respect to the planet frame (where the photon has energy $E$) is
\[
E'=E\gamma(1-v)
\]
\item Use this expression to find the energy of one photon going in the positive x-direction as well as a photon going in the negative x-direction for the observer in the ship frame. The latter photon is among the photons that will bee seen for the observer in the space ship following ship A.
\item Use the expression for $E'$ in terms of $E$ to derive the relativistic Doppler formula
\[
\frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda}=\left(\sqrt{\frac{1+v}{1-v}}-1\right)
\]
\item Use this expression to find which colour the explosion has for the observer in the ship frame. Finally, meet with the other student and look at both videos to check your results. Did you calculate the colour in the other frame correctly?
\item Show that the relativistic Doppler formula is consistent with the normal Doppler formula for low velocities. {\bf Hint:} Make a Taylor expansion of $f(v)=\sqrt{(1+v)/(1-v)}$ for small $v$.
\item This exercise was inspired by a process which happens in nature: An electron and a positron (the anti particle of the electron having the same mass) are approaching each other with the same velocity in opposite directions in the laboratory frame. In the collision, both particles are annihilated and two photons are produced. One photon travels in the positive x direction, the other in the negative x direction. Which laboratory velocitues would the electrons and positrons need to have in order to obtain photons with the same colours as in the above questions?
